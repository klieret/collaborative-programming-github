Slides to introduce collaborative programming with git.
This lecture aims to be 90% hands-on and at least 90% collaborative.

- Part 1: Learn to fork, branch, create PRs, resolve merge conflicts, all from the GitHub web interface
- Part 2: Let's contribute from the command line
- Part 3: Learning to love git

> **Note**
> You can use these slides for your teaching, too (see license)! Contributions are very welcome as well.

> **Note**
> PDF versions are available in the releases.
