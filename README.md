Slides to introduce collaborative programming with github and git.
The first part of the slides makes extensive use of the github web interface
to provide students with more intuition and flatten the learning curve.
The second part then turns to the command line.

> **Note**
> You can use these slides for your teaching, too (see license)! Contributions are very welcome as well.

Slides originally created for the [CoDaS-HEP 2022 school](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1151367/) (PDF version of the slides available in the release).
